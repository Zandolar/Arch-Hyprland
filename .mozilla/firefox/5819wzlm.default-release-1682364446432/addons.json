Oxford says some words are valid both ways; thus I kept both and the user decides which he prefers.\nFor ize/ise, both are accepted in certain words. Oxford Dictionaries only refers that these accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts and not for regular users.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\nEDIT: https://proofingtoolgui.org/faq.html#issue1\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis, via e-mail or GitHub. If it is in the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\nRemoving US words:\nIf you find Americanisms, which appear both in Oxford and Collins dictionaries as such with a British correspondence, please send them to me for analysis and removal.\n\nArchaic words:\nI will only add archaic words if they don't interfere with other words. Some literacy writing circles require these kinds of words.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller using it, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nFurthermore, it is suitable as a basis for Commonwealth and European English.\n\nIt doesn't matter your race, religion, gender, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are correct, I look for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015, I purchased an “Oxford Gold Account” to have a higher access to Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nOn 25.Aug.2013 I released a “forked” British speller V2.00, which has been made available to OpenOffice/LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. So far, I have added 140 434+ words (as of V3.3.2).\n\n\n\nNOTICE:\nI have been publicly attacked regarding my dictionary, even in front of other developers. They only know how to criticise instead of suggesting words/fixes for the dictionary. There are millions of words, and I can't find them all by myself.\n\nThis is a serious project, I have been paying out of my own pocket hundreds of EUR per year for web hosting, domains, premium account in Oxford Dictionaries, etc. so that people can enjoy quality work freely.\n\nI am a disabled person and open-source is almost all I have left in life.\n","weeklyDownloads":241,"type":"dictionary","creator":{"name":"Marco A.G.Pinto","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/10237465/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/285/285477.png?modified=1707738420","width":1181,"height":482,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/285/285477.jpg?modified=1707738420","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":218,"caption":"Installing the dictionary on Firefox (2023-07-28)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/285/285478.png?modified=1707738420","width":506,"height":615,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/285/285478.jpg?modified=1707738420","thumbnailWidth":329,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Enabling the dictionary on Firefox 1/2 (2023-07-28)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/285/285479.png?modified=1707738420","width":947,"height":487,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/285/285479.jpg?modified=1707738420","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":274,"caption":"Enabling the dictionary on Firefox 2/2 (2023-07-28)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/285/285587.png?modified=1707738420","width":1442,"height":785,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/285/285587.jpg?modified=1707738420","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":290,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 204)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/285/285588.png?modified=1707738420","width":1442,"height":785,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/285/285588.jpg?modified=1707738420","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":290,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 204)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/285/285589.png?modified=1707738420","width":1442,"height":785,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/285/285589.jpg?modified=1707738420","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":290,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 204)"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5926,"reviewCount":30,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/british-english-dictionary-2/reviews/","updateDate":1714540819000},{"id":"idcac-pub@guus.ninja","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2766/2766861-32.png?modified=0ce8cd02","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2766/2766861-64.png?modified=0ce8cd02","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2766/2766861-128.png?modified=0ce8cd02"},"name":"I still don't care about cookies","version":"1.1.4","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4216095/istilldontcareaboutcookies-1.1.4.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Dont-Care-About-Cookies","supportURL":"https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Dont-Care-About-Cookies/issues","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/","description":"Community version of the popular extension \"I don't care about cookies\"\n\nhttps://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Dont-Care-About-Cookies","fullDescription":"The EU regulations require that any website using tracking cookies must get user's permission before installing them.
